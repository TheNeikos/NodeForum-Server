Style Guide
-----------

While, as of now, there is no style guide to the code.
The Source Tree does have a specific layout, it is modeled on MEANJS:

```
/                   Is the Root directory of the app
/app                Is where the flesh of the application resides
/app/models         Is where the Database Models reside
/app/controllers    Is where the Controllers reside
/app/routes         Is where the Routes reside
/app/tests          Is where the Tests reside
/app/views          Does not exist!
/config             For Configuration files
```
